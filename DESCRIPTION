Title: Quickly Fit Many Mixture Models with Expectation Maximization
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Ian", "Howson", , "ian@mutexlabs.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package makes EM mixture model fitting faster in two cases:
    where you have many datasets to fit or where you need random
    initialisation on difficult-to-fit datasets. It offers multicore support
    and CUDA acceleration to perform fitting quickly. Supported mixture
    distributions are univariate Normal and Inverse Gaussian.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.2)
